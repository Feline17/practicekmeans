Correlation between employment rate and female employment rate using an old Gapminder dataset.


Q. Which columns did you choose to plot and why?

A. Employment rate and female employment rate.

A. Because I had a sense they would correlate but maybe I'd find something interesting :)


Q. Which filters and / or sorting did you apply to the data and why?

A. Sorted by country name first.

A. Then when I filtered by highest female employment rates and lowest employment rates, I sorted them by rates, descending and ascending respectively.


Q. Referring to your labelled 'data points of interest', explain what you think is interesting about this plot.

A. Well, they're the countries with the highest female employment rates and lowest employment rates. That's interesting in itself.

A. Something else that was interesting is that Burundi is in Africa because I expected a European country to have the highest female employment rate.

A. West Bank and Gaza make sense to have the lowest employment rate because of terrorism :(
